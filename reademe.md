# Child Mind Institute 2025 kaggle competition participation

This is my second participation to a kaggle competition.  
The first one was the [Geophysical Waveform Inversion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/waveform-inversion) competition.  
It was a test for me to get familiar with the full workflow of a compettion from start to finish(I started 2 weeks before the end).
